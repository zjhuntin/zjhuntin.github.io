										<h3>Iron Yard Graduate</h3>
									</header>
									<p>My name is Zachary Huntington-Meath, and I'm a longtime resident of the Triangle area of NC. I studied Biology and Chemisty at UNC-Greensboro, before graduating with honors in 2011. After working for a medical testing company for two years, I discovered my passion for computer programming and decided to change careers. I enrolled in The Iron Yard, where I spent 60-80 hours a week, for 12 weeks, learning anything I could about Python Engineering. I'm searching for new challenges, new opportunities, and new environments where I can learn and grow as a programmer.</p>

										<h3>Python Clutch</h3>
									</header>
									<p>This was my final project for The Iron Yard. After proposing the idea to my class, three classmates joined me in working for the last three weeks to make that idea a reality: <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/gordon-fierce/43/67/780/en">Gordon Fierce</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/joel-thompson/b5/743/7ba">Joel Thompson</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanhammond1">Jordan Hammond</a>. Python Clutch aims to be a fast resource for Python developers to compare Python packages on objective metrics like development history and adoption. This year's Python cohort had no way to evaluate the merits of packages without extensive research. By aggregating info from PypI and source code repositories, Python clutch helps Pythonistas quickly find packages that address their problems and that have a balance of wide adoption and active development.

										<h3>Blackjack</h3>
									</header>
									<p>This was my second major project at the Iron Yard, where I created a basic Blackjack game with additional features. It was my first time using classes in a program, and I had to learn how to translate simple rules into working code. It taught me to plan ahead, learn how to consolidate code, and monitor version control. Additional features to the game included making a boot which contains multiple decks, as well as a surrender option to allow players to give up early to avoid greater losses. I also added an insurance option, which is a side bet the player can make if the dealer has a face-up ace.</p>

										<h3>Code Learner</h3>
									</header>
									<p>This was a machine learning project that I developed at the Iron Yard. I pair programmed this project with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielkn">Daniel Newell</a>. We were assigned to create a classifier that would be able to tell the difference between 10 different programming languages. To give the learner more data, we created a web scraper to gather code examples from Rosetta Code. With our code examples, we created a classifier that could correctly guess the code type from snippets of code over 90% of the time.</p>

										<h3>Traffic Simulator</h3>
									</header>
									<p>This was a project on creating simulations to analyze the behavior of drivers on a new road to determine the optimal speed limits. To do this, we simulated traffic on the road by creating a standard set of rules that all the simulated drivers would follow. We then simulated different styles of driving, as well as different road types. The graph above shows the position of 40 cars on a 7000 meter length of road. Each black dot is a car, and the areas that have denser concentrations of black demonstrate areas of congestion.

							<h3>Safe Run</h3>
						</header>
						<p>This was a project <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-mitsch/29/9a2/951">John Mitsch</a> and I worked on at <a href="http://triangleopendataday.com/">Triangle Open Data Day</a>, a hackathon held in Raleigh while I was at The Iron Yard. John and I went there together to find a project to work on and we ended up making our own. It was based on the idea that people want to feel safe when they are running, so we decided to make a map that runners could use to decide which routes to use. We combined Raleigh crime data and NC DOT pedestrian crash data to create a heatmap showing how dangerous a place may be by the density of crimes and crashes that have occured there.
